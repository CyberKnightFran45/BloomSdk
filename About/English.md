# üå∏ Blossom SDK

A modular library collection developed in **C# (.NET 9+)** by **FranZ**. These libraries are designed for handling files used in games and apps, especially from **EA** and **PopCap Games**. The toolkit is also accessible to non-programmers who want to start making their own **MODS**.

The package also includes cross-platform applications (Android, iOS, Windows) that make direct use of these libraries.
